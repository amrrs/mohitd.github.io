Hello world! Don't all beginners start off doing something like that? In the past, I have had my own blog and have written posts for it, but there wasn't any impetus driving me to continue writing. Eventually, school consumed my usual writing time. It's been a while since I was writing personal blog posts, i.e. not through the enticement of a company or for money, and I'm willing to give it another shot.

But first, I'd better introduce myself. Hello! I am Mohit Deshpande, an undergraduate student and researcher in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at Ohio State University. I'm currently working on my thesis in Databases and Human-Computer Interaction. My research interests are in Human-Computer Interaction, computer vision, and deep learning, and I try to keep up-to-date with ongoing work in those fields. I'm planning on going to graduate school for a Ph.D. after I receive my B.S. There's more information about me on the [about]({{ site.baseurl }}/about) page. 

Now that introductions have been covered, let's get right to it.

The primary reason I'm writing posts again is to improve my writing style. I already have a strong grasp on grammar (thank you, high school AP English!), but good writing is much more than a collection of grammatically-correct sentences. Particularly for nonfiction writing (most of my current and future work), it's all about creating a clear and cohesive argument or pith, supported by data. This is the cornerstone for good work, and its skills are generally transferrable from one type of writing to another. However, we can't just say a topic and list bullet-point facts about it. Incorporating the storytelling aspect from fictional work, we need to weave a story with our data. Check out Dr. Joshua Schimel's [Writing Science](https://schimelwritingscience.wordpress.com/). My future posts will strive to adhere to these philosophies. 

Regarding post content itself, I'm planning on discussing topics more central to my own [interests]({{ site.baseurl }}/about), and I've noticed that these topics aren't quite covered in the best way. For example, media tends to exaggerate (or interpret incorrectly in a few cases) implications of research, often with click-bait titles. But it's not their fault; they're after quantity rather than quality. 
When I hear about any new thing or idea that I find interesting, I tend to spend the more mundane tasks of my life, like waiting for a bus, thinking about it intensly. Through critical thinking, we hope to gain insight into a problem or notion. And critical thinking is like any other skill: to be good at it, you need to practice it. This brings me to another reason why I want to start writing again: exercise my critical thinking. I'm going to practice by forming coherant sentences and paragraphs, and I'll need a place to write these words down, i.e. this blog! I can't predict what future content will be. But twist, warp, and stretch an idea or thought to its extremes, and you're bound to come up with something interesting. 

Now it's time for rhetorical questions!

_Does the world really need another blog?_ 
Who knows? Who cares? Life is too short to worry about such things. Each blog is free to have its own perspective on anything, and we shouldn't limit ourselves to listening to one side anyway. Check out Adichie's TED talk titled ["The Danger of a Single Story"](https://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story). It might be more applicable than you think! 

_Why should I read this blog?_
I'm planning on discussing some pretty interesting topics in computer vision and machine learning but not exclusively. I can't begin to predict what posts I'll write since they'll be tied to current events most likely. I _can_ make one promise however: to abide by the writing philosophies that I outlined earlier in this post. I think this blog will be an interesting endeavour and hope you agree!

_What's with the blog's subtitle "Defining the Edge" anyway?_ 
This is what I think researchers do and what research is. We talk about "being on the cutting-edge" of technologies, but that implies that you know where the edge is! Research helps us find that edge of human knowledge and extend it a little further into the unknown. Check out [The Illustrated Guide to a Ph.D.](http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/) by Matt Might.

_Are you going to stop asking these rhetorical questions?_ 
Yes.

Hopefully this goes without saying, but **the opinions voiced on here are purely my own**! More people need to get into the habit of collecting their own data and forming their own opinions instead of taking on the opinions of those around them.

With all of that said, I'd better get started!
