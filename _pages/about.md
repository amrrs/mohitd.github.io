Hello World! I'm Mohit, an alumnus of The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. I was a researcher in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering in the [Interactive Data Systems](interact.osu.edu) research group, led by [Dr. Arnab Nandi](www.arnab.org), that worked on information extraction from images for databases.

I am currently working at [Amazon Lab126](http://lab126.com/) in Sunnyvale, California.
