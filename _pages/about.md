Hello World! I'm Mohit, an undergraduate student and researcher in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. My work focuses on information extraction from images: given any image with text, e.g., a flyer, poster, document, etc., my work aims to identify important information in that image, e.g., names, places, dates, times, etc., and extract that information into a database, spreadsheet, or calendar, all from a single image and completely user-customizable. I am a member of the [Interactive Data Systems](interact.osu.edu) research group, led by [Dr. Arnab Nandi](www.arnab.org).

I am currently working towards my B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering, with a specialization in AI, at The Ohio State University and plan to graduate with Honors Research Distinction in May 2018.
