Hello World! I'm Mohit, an undergraduate student and researcher in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. My thesis work focuses on information extraction from images for databases. Given any image with text, e.g., a flyer, poster, document, etc., my work aims to identify important information in that image, e.g., names, places, dates, times, etc., and extract that information into a database, spreadsheet, or calendar, all from a single image and completely user-customizable. The goal of my thesis work is to move us towards a paperless society where anything, including information on images, is queryable. I am a member of the [Interactive Data Systems](interact.osu.edu) research group, led by [Dr. Arnab Nandi](www.arnab.org).

My primary research interests lie in joint modeling of images and text as well as direct applications of this to other domains such as my thesis work. The joint modeling work I'm investigating includes image-text embeddings, novel neural architectures for merging images and text, and non-neural heuristic approaches for limited data use-cases. 

I am currently working towards my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering, with a specialization in artificial intelligence, at The Ohio State University and plan to graduate with Honors Research Distinction in May 2018.
