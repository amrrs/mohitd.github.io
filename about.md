I am Mohit Deshpande, an undergraduate student in Computer Science and Engineering at Ohio State University. I'm also a researcher currently working on my thesis in Databases and Human-Computer Interaction and a member of the [Interactive Data Systems](http://interact.osu.edu/) group under [Dr. Arnab Nandi](arnab.org). My research interests lie in Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision, and deep learning. I plan on doing a Ph.D. after I graduate for the essence of the title: the love of knowledge.

I have interned at [Air Force Research Lab](http://www.wpafb.af.mil/afrl) where I did some work in surface reconstruction. I have also interned at [Hyland](https://www.onbase.com/) where I was an iOS developer, building a cross-platform PDF parsing library in C++. For the summmer of 2017, I'll be working at [Amazon](https://amazon.com).

Aside from academic pursuits, I play jazz guitar with friends and compose jazz charts on occasion; I also Trumpet 1 in the Athletic Band at OSU. I like teaching, and, consequently, I create tons of education content for [Zenva](https://zenva.com/) along the lines of video courses, blog posts, and eBooks on computer science topics like app development, computer vision, and programming languages. I also help as a project mentor for [Discovery Lab Global](http://www.discoverylabglobal.com/) on artificial intelligence, computer vision, and mobile app projects. As side projects, I build electronics and am starting work on a deep learning autonomous robot using various components orchestrated by an [NVidia Jetson TK1](http://www.nvidia.com/object/jetson-tk1-embedded-dev-kit.html).
