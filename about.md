Hello! My name is Mohit Deshpande, and I am a fourth-year undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Engineering at Ohio State University. I'm also a researcher currently working on my thesis in Human-Computer Interaction and a member of the [Interactive Data Systems](http://interact.osu.edu/) group under [Dr. Arnab Nandi](http://arnab.org/). In addition to my thesis, I'm also working on creating multi-modal machine learning models and learning representations. My research interests are Computer Vision and Machine Learning.

I have interned at [Air Force Research Lab](http://www.wpafb.af.mil/afrl) where I did some work in surface reconstruction. I have also interned at [Hyland](https://www.onbase.com/) where I was an iOS developer, building a cross-platform PDF parsing library in C++ and integrating it into the OnBase iOS app. This past summer (May 2017 – July 2017), I was working at [Amazon Lab126](https://www.lab126.com/), Amazon's research-and-development company, writing code to create occupancy spaces from multiple disparate sensors.

Aside from academic pursuits, I enjoy teaching, and, consequently, I create tons of education content for [Zenva](https://zenva.com/) along the lines of video courses, blog posts, and eBooks on computer science topics like app development, computer vision, and programming languages. I also help as a project mentor for [Discovery Lab Global](http://www.discoverylabglobal.com/) on artificial intelligence, computer vision, and mobile app projects. I like to train deep neural models on interesting datasets to see what kinds of problems they can solve in other fields like physics and medicine.
